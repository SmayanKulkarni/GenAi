First, gratitude is a powerful tool. By acknowledging the things we’re thankful for—no matter how small—we shift our focus away from what’s lacking to what’s abundant. Try starting or ending each day by listing three things you’re grateful for. You’ll be amazed at how this simple habit can transform your perspective.  \\n\\nSecond, surround yourself with positive influences. The people we spend time with and the content we consume shape our thoughts and emotions. Seek out friends, mentors, or even books that uplift and inspire you. And don’t underestimate the power of self-talk. Be kind to yourself. Replace “I can’t do this” with “I’ll give it my best shot.”')]"
